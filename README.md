## Original analysis

The original analysis relied on the **R programming languange** and used `R` in version `3.5.0`. Additionally, we heavily relied on the bioconductor package [scater](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scater.html) in version `scater 1.4.0` for results from single-cell RNA-seq and `scater 1.8.0` for results from single-cell ATAC-seq. The details on the [session](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/sessionInfo.html) can be found in [original-analysis/RNA-seq_sessionInfo.txt](original-analysis/RNA-seq_sessionInfo.txt) and [original-analysis/ATAC-seq_sessionInfo.txt](original-analysis/ATAC-seq_sessionInfo.txt), respectively.

Please see the accompanying [README.md](original-analysis/README.md) for details on how to replicate preprocessing or re-create figures from the manuscript.

## Updated analysis

In addition to the original analysis, we will provide an up-to-date re-analysis of the data from the manuscript. *Watch* this repository to be notified on further updates.
